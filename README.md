# TextMagic-python-PRTG-integration
PRTG runs this Windows script in order to send a notification

This is made with the purpose of 
1) using a primary and backup gateway
2) Using the text to speech feature
3) You are using windows

This is a very niche oriented usage, and this code is probably not useful to most people.

This was written in Python 3
REQUIRES DNS PYTHON http://www.dnspython.org/
REQUIRES textmagic python library https://www.textmagic.com/docs/api/python/

I recommend WinPython if you are using windows.
